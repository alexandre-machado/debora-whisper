"""The voice chat's LLM (OpenVINO GenAI), in a process of its own.

Building an LLMPipeline holds the GIL for the whole compile: inside the app
that froze the tray, the overlay and the hotkey (4 s with a warm cache, much
longer without). Here only this process waits.

    python -m debora_whisper.llm_server <model_dir> <device> <cache_dir>

One JSON object per line. On stdout:
    {"ready": "GPU", "seconds": 4.2}    loaded (on the CPU if the device failed)
    {"failed": "..."}                    loaded nowhere; the process exits
    {"log": "..."}                       for the app's log
    {"id": 1, "text": "..."}             a piece of reply 1
    {"id": 1, "done": true}              reply 1 ended (or was cancelled)
    {"id": 1, "error": "..."}            reply 1 failed
On stdin:
    {"id": 1, "messages": [...], "max_new_tokens": 400}
    {"cancel": 1}
The process exits when stdin closes, so it never outlives the app.
