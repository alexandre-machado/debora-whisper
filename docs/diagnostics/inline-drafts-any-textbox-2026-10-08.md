# Inline drafts in any text box

Research date: 2026-10-08. Follow-up to
[windows-text-insertion-2026-10-08.md](windows-text-insertion-2026-10-08.md).
Since `ce67c94`, drafts default to the overlay (`inline_drafts: false`). This
study asks how drafts can be typed into the target and rewritten safely in
any editable control.

## Why the current inline mode cannot be made universal

Inline mode types a draft, then rewrites it with Shift+Left × N and
Backspace. This is correct only if the N characters before the caret still
match the typed draft. Nothing guarantees that:

- the editor transforms input: autocomplete, auto-closing pairs, autocorrect,
  smart quotes, auto-indent (VS Code/Monaco, Word, browser editors);
- the target processes input asynchronously, so the deletion keys can arrive
  before the pasted text has landed;
- the user moves the caret or types in the same control
  (`same_input_target` only compares HWNDs);
- Shift+Left selects by grapheme or by line in some editors and not by
  UTF-16 unit.

Better timing or verification does not solve this problem. Simulated keys only
send intent: the program never holds a reference to the text it inserted.
Dragon has the same limitation. It reads and sets text directly only in
"standard" controls (Edit, RichEdit, HTML fields). Elsewhere it sends
keystrokes, and Nuance documents that selection and correction fail once the
user touches the mouse or keyboard. Its workaround for those controls is a
separate Dictation Box: overlay-only drafts plus one transfer of the final text,
which is our new default ([Nuance][dragon-box]).

## The mechanism editors already support: TSF compositions

Every editor that accepts Chinese, Japanese or Korean input supports
*compositions*. A composition is a range of provisional text owned by a text
service. The service rewrites the range while the user is still entering text,
then commits it. Microsoft's documentation uses speech as its example:

> While the user is speaking, the speech text service creates a composition.
> This composition will remain intact until the entire speech input is
> complete. [...] the application should not perform any spelling or grammar
> checking on any composition text. ([Microsoft: Compositions][ms-comp])

This addresses the problems listed above:

| Current problem | With a composition |
| --- | --- |
| Shift+Left assumes the caret did not move | The range is a TSF object anchored in the document, and edits elsewhere shift its anchors |
| Autocomplete/autocorrect alter the draft | Applications are expected to suspend such processing in compositions |
| `...` and provisional text look final | The text service supplies display attributes, normally rendered as an underline |
| Focus change or click elsewhere | The application terminates the composition and the service receives `ITfCompositionSink::OnCompositionTerminated` |
| Clipboard is overwritten | No clipboard is involved: `ITfRange::SetText` in an edit session |

Key APIs: `ITfContextComposition::StartComposition`, `ITfRange::SetText`
within `ITfContext::RequestEditSession`, `ITfComposition::EndComposition`
([Microsoft: Compositions][ms-comp]).

### Coverage

- **TSF applications**, such as Chromium and therefore Chrome, Edge,
  Electron/VS Code ([Chromium `TSFTextStore`][cr-tsf]), WPF, WinUI/UWP, Office
  and Windows Terminal. Windows Terminal rewrote its IME integration in 1.21
  ([WT 1.21][wt121]).
- **IMM32-only applications** (classic Win32, many Qt/Java/game toolkits) via
  CUAS, which bridges TSF text services to applications that do not use TSF.
  The switch is `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\CTF\SystemShared\CUAS`
  ([Mozc `imm_util.cc`][mozc-imm]). Test before assuming specific behavior.
- **Store/packaged apps**: a TIP running there inherits the AppContainer
  restrictions. It must be TSF-based and digitally signed, or Windows blocks
  it ([Microsoft: IME requirements][ms-ime-req], [Windows 8 cookbook][ms-w8]).
- **Not covered**: applications that read raw keyboard input (games, some
  remote-desktop/VM clients), protected processes, and the secure desktop.
  These continue to use overlay plus paste.

The set of controls that support IMEs is the closest approximation of "any
text box" that Windows offers.

## Precedents

| Project | What it does | Relevance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Plover TIP][plover] (GPL-2+) | Plover is a stenography engine that, like us, retracts and rewrites output. It replaced "SendInput backspace storms" with a native x64 TIP doing `ITfRange::SetText` composition rewrites, controlled from Python over a named pipe ([tip README][plover-tip]) | Nearly the same problem. Protocol: JSON lines over `\\.\pipe\plover_tip_v1_<sid>`, ops `set_composition`, `commit`, `finalize`, `cancel`, `undo_committed`, `focus`/`blur`; pipe DACL grants the user and ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES |
| [OpenLess PR #214][openless] (closed, not merged) | A dictation app committing ASR text through its own TIP; x64 + Win32 DLLs over a named pipe; switches the IME profile during an insertion and restores it afterward | Shows practical failures: 32-bit hosts need a Win32 DLL; Word rejects synchronous edit sessions (`TF_E_SYNCHRONOUS`, fixed with asynchronous sessions); the profile-restore code had a GUID round-trip bug |
| [PIME][pime] (LGPL-2.1) | TSF DLL + launcher + Python/Node backends over named pipes | Mature architecture with a C++ DLL and Python backend |
| Mozc, Microsoft SampleIME | Full TIPs | Permissively licensed reference code; this project is MIT, so do not copy Plover's GPL code |

## Proposed design

### Components

1. **`npu_whisper_tip.dll`**, x64 and x86, C++ or Rust (`windows` crate). This
   is a minimal keyboard TIP: it passes keys through, does not change the
   layout, and only rewrites a composition on request.
2. **Pipe server in the engine**, `\\.\pipe\npu_whisper_tip_<sid>`, with
   JSON lines. The engine is the server, and every TIP instance (one per
   process with focus) is a client.
3. **Inline-draft adapter** in `dictation_engine.py`, replacing
   `type_draft_text`/`delete_text` when a TIP client owns the focused
   context.

### Protocol (draft)

```
TIP -> engine  {"op":"focus","pid":1234,"hwnd":...,"ctx":7}
TIP -> engine  {"op":"blur","ctx":7}
engine -> TIP  {"op":"set","seg":42,"seq":3,"text":"Olá tudo"}     # start or rewrite
engine -> TIP  {"op":"commit","seg":42,"seq":4,"text":"Olá, tudo bem? "}
engine -> TIP  {"op":"cancel","seg":42}                             # empty final
TIP -> engine  {"op":"ack","seg":42,"seq":3}
TIP -> engine  {"op":"terminated","seg":42,"text":"Olá tudo"}      # app ended it
```

- `set` rewrites the full composition text. Unlike prefix diffs, it does not
  depend on what was typed before.
- `commit` writes the final text into the composition range and ends it, as one
  edit session.
- `terminated` occurs when the user clicks elsewhere, types, or the app
  cancels. The engine stops tracking the draft. Policy question: either leave
  the committed text and paste the final at the new caret (the current
  focus-change behavior), or keep an `ITfRange` for the terminated text and
  replace it if its content is unchanged when the final arrives. Plover's
  `undo_committed` shows that ranges remain usable after the commit.
- Edit sessions use `TF_ES_READWRITE | TF_ES_ASYNCDONTCARE`. `TF_ES_SYNC` can
  fail with `TF_E_SYNCHRONOUS`, and `DoEditSession` may never run if the
  context is destroyed, so the engine waits for `ack` with a timeout
  ([Microsoft: RequestEditSession][ms-res]).

### Per-segment routing

```
draft arrives
  ├─ TIP client is focused and acked recently  -> set/commit composition
  ├─ inline_drafts == "keys" (legacy, opt-in)   -> current Shift+Left path
  └─ otherwise                                   -> overlay; final pasted once
```

Choosing this per segment, based on the focused context, provides the
fallback: TSF/IMM controls get inline drafts, others get the overlay. No
per-application configuration is needed.

### Activation: the main risk

A keyboard TIP runs only while its profile is the active input method. Options:

- **A. User selects "NPU Whisper" as the input method**, using Win+Space.
  This is the simplest and most reliable option and is what Plover requires.
  Register one profile per language the user has, with that language's
  layout as `hklSubstitute`, so that typing is unchanged. Cost: one entry
  in the input-method list, plus the user must select it.
- **B. The engine activates the profile only while dictating** through
  `ITfInputProcessorProfileMgr::ActivateProfile` with `TF_IPPMF_FORSESSION`
  ("all threads in the current desktop") and restores the previous profile
  afterward ([Microsoft: ActivateProfile][ms-activate]). This is the
  OpenLess approach. It is transparent, but activation from another process,
  timing on the first draft, and interaction with CJK users' IMEs are
  unverified. Plover warns that changing the HKL under a TIP causes keys to
  repeat (`uuuuufffff`).

Recommended: implement A first because it is deterministic, then test B in the
spike.

### Packaging and security

- Native DLLs (x64 + x86) are built in CI, signed (required in Store apps),
  and shipped inside the wheel. Registration runs as a separate, explicit
  administrator command (`npu-whisper-cli tip install|uninstall`:
  `DllRegisterServer`, `RegisterProfile`, `RegisterCategory`), never at
  startup; AGENTS.md forbids runtime installs. Updating a DLL that running
  apps have loaded requires closing those apps or using a versioned path.
- Free signing options (researched 2026-10-08):
  - **SignPath Foundation**: free for OSI-licensed open-source projects with
    an automated build from the public repository (GitHub Actions). The key
    remains in SignPath's HSM, the certificate names the Foundation as
    publisher, and the project must publish a code-signing policy. PIME, a
    TSF IME, is a listed project ([SignPath][signpath], [terms][signpath-terms],
    [PIME on SignPath][signpath-pime]). This is the preferred option.
  - **Certificate generated during installation**: the administrator command
    creates a self-signed certificate, signs the shipped DLLs, trusts the
    certificate on that machine, and deletes the private key, so the key
    cannot sign other files. This is free and needs no external approval, but
    the trust is local only. Smart App Control and Store-app loading
    still need testing.
  - **Unsigned**: Microsoft's Windows 8 guidance requires signing third-party
    IMEs and says Windows blocks noncompliant ones in Store apps
    ([cookbook][ms-w8]); the current requirements page no longer mentions
    signing ([requirements][ms-ime-req]). The spike should test whether
    unsigned DLLs load in desktop and packaged apps.
  - Not free or not eligible: Azure Artifact Signing costs about US$9.99 per
    month and accepts individuals only from the USA/Canada
    ([Microsoft][ms-signing]); Certum's open-source certificate is paid.
- The TIP is loaded into every application that has focus, so a crash there
  crashes the user's application. The DLL must be minimal and never block the
  UI thread: pipe I/O happens on a worker thread, and work is marshaled to
  the TSF thread through a message window, as in Plover.
- The engine currently runs elevated, but the TIP runs at medium IL or in
  AppContainer. The pipe DACL must explicitly allow those clients. Draft text
  is sensitive, so the engine should send it only to the client whose
  `pid` owns the foreground window (`GetWindowThreadProcessId`) and ignore
  others. CTF has a history of cross-process vulnerabilities
  (CVE-2019-1162, [Project Zero via THN][ctf-cve]), so the pipe must not
  accept commands from the TIP beyond the events above.

## Interim option without native code: verified key rewrite

UI Automation can verify state before deleting text.
`IUIAutomationTextPattern2::GetCaretRange` returns the caret, and its
`isActive` output reports whether the control has focus
([Microsoft: GetCaretRange][ms-caret]). Before Shift+Left, read the text
immediately before the caret and confirm that the selection is empty. Delete
only if that text ends with the typed draft; otherwise, consider the draft
lost and paste the final.

This would fix "corrupted text" (it becomes "draft left behind") in controls
that expose TextPattern (Notepad, Word, Chromium with UIA enabled since
Chrome 126, [Chrome UIA][cr-uia]). It does not fix autocomplete/auto-close
(the check fails and inline drafts are abandoned) or editors with partial
accessibility trees (Monaco exposes only nearby lines). A race also remains
between the check and the keys. This option is useful as a guard for the
legacy `keys` mode, not as a path to "any text box".

## Spike plan

1. Minimal TIP (x64) using SampleIME/Mozc as reference: one profile for
   pt-BR/ABNT2, a pipe client, `set`/`commit`/`cancel`. Python test client
   that sends a scripted draft sequence.
2. Matrix, recording `ack` latency and final document text: Notepad, WordPad
   replacement/RichEdit, Word, Chrome `<textarea>` and `contenteditable`,
   Google Docs, VS Code editor and integrated terminal, Windows Terminal
   (Claude Code), Slack/Teams (Electron/WebView2), a Win32 Edit control
   (CUAS), a Qt app, a 32-bit app.
3. Cases: caret moved mid-draft, typing during composition, focus change,
   autocomplete popup open, `auto_enter`, emoji/accents, two drafts per
   second.
4. Activation B: `ActivateProfile(FORSESSION)` from the engine process while
   another app is focused; measure the time until the TIP connects.

Decision gate: if the matrix shows inline compositions working in the
editors that currently fail (VS Code, browser editors, Word), proceed with
x86 build, signing, and packaging. Otherwise, keep overlay-only drafts and
add only the UIA guard.
